ðŸ‘‹Hi, my name is Nathan Diekema.
I graduated from California Polytechnic State University with a 
degree in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.
I am now pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics at Cal Poly. 
I love to code and enjoy working on collaborative projects with my 
peers. I'm interested in big data and how we can take advantage of
advanced algorithms and machine learning in order to extract interesting
trends and patterns from it.
