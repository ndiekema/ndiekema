ðŸ‘‹Hi, my name is Nathan Diekema.
I graduated from California Polytechnic State University with a 
degree in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science in June 2021.
I am now pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics at Cal Poly, set to graduate in June 2022. 
I love to code and enjoy working on collaborative projects with my 
peers. I'm interested in big data, particularly how we can take advantage of
machine learning and artificial intelligence to extract interesting insights.
