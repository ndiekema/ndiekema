ðŸ‘‹Hi, my name is Nathan Diekema.
I graduated from California Polytechnic State University with a 
B.S. in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science in June 2021.
I more recently finished an M.S. in Business Analytics at Cal Poly, in June 2022. 
I love to code and enjoy working on collaborative projects with my 
peers. I'm interested in big data, particularly how we can take advantage of
machine learning and artificial intelligence to extract interesting insights.
